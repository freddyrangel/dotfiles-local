# Dotfiles

My collection of Linux dotfiles, which I use in conjuction with [thoughtbot's
dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and [Powerline]
(https://github.com/powerline/powerline).

This will mostly work on OS X except perhaps the Powerline configuration.

Clone this repository and symlink the files to your home directory.
